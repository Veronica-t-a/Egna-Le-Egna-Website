                <p> When I first stepped onto campus, I was worried about a lot of things. So many questions were circulating in my head: How will I get used to this big campus? How will I make friends? What if I didn’t get along with my roommate? What if classes are too hard? The list goes on. Even though I had spent hours talking to college students, researching, and reading as much as humanly possible about what to expect, the truth was that I still had no idea what to expect when I got to the campus. The biggest question was, however, something I tried not to think about: what if I didn’t fit in? At the beginning of a lot of the orientation events, everyone made a point of emphasizing that the admissions committee does not make mistakes: If you are there, you are meant to be there. We laughed every time.</p>
                <p> When classes began, I began to understand why they felt the need to repeat that same line. From the first day, I felt so out of place in every class I stepped into. It didn’t make sense, but I felt behind even before we had any assignments to properly  fall behind on. Every person I met seemed more talented, smarter, and more deserving of a spot in the university. People come from different backgrounds: some have had more opportunities than others, and even when they are the same age, two people can still be at different stages of their lives. I understood this as a fact of life, but I could not stop myself from somehow feeling inadequate. Everytime I met someone on campus who seemed more put together, more successful, and more experienced, I felt more and more out of place. But what I have learned over the years is that it is not just me:  A lot of people I’ve me5t on campus over the last two years have also expressed the same feelings. </p>
                <p> According to the Harvard Business Review, “Imposter syndrome can be defined as a collection of feelings of inadequacy that persist despite evident success. ‘Imposters’ suffer from chronic self-doubt and a sense of intellectual fraudulence that override any feelings of success or external proof of their competence.” While it may seem like you are alone in these feelings, you are most certainly not: most people feel this way at one point or another in their lives. </p>
                <p> So how do you fight this? For most of my freshman year, I didn't know. As time passed, however, I began to share my feelings with my friends who shared those feelings. It also helps to confront yourself whenever you begin to feel this way: ask yourself where the thoughts are coming from. It’s important to remind yourselves of how you got to where you are in life. In fact, you should write down these points on a piece of paper and look over it every time you start to feel out of place again. It may seem ridiculous, but it is so, so important to do whatever you need to do to keep yourself grounded.</p>
